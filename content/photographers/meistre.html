			<p><b>Born in 1975. Lives and works in Grahamstown, South Africa.</b></p>
			<p class="justified">Brent Meistre works mainly with traditional photographic processes (including hand colour printing) incorporated 
			into bodies of work which also feature video, stop-frame animation and sound installations.</p>
			<p class="justified">Much of his work investigates the possibilities of single and multiple images as cinematic and thereby plays with 
			the veiling of meanings and narratives. His works are often positioned within particular time frames and frameworks within Southern 
			Africa evoking melancholia, loss and longing. In this context he uses the photographic and filmic to unravel and complicate the notion 
			of the photograph being a document of historical fact, contra the medium’s possibilities for suggesting the unsaid.</p>
			<p class="justified">To point a camera towards land in Southern Africa is to draw the history of the continent to your eye. A history 
			which is archaeologically layered, complex, implicit, but also a blind spot; a specular highlight on the retina, an aberration that 
			de-registers the picture. Every tilt and pan is a political act, an act of representation, of framing, of remarking of boundaries and 
			borders, the camera recording, re-constructing and complicating the ground. This, an un-representable no-man’s land, is where we find it
			difficult or even impossible to position ourselves.</p>
			<p class="justfified">The land before us is a strange but familiar land, a no-man’s land, cultivated, demarcated, and stratified with the 
			patina of history. The ruins above the firma that lies on its skin, erodes quietly as time, history and memory accelerate its absence. The 
			photographs in this collection are about that skin, a flat expanse of a body that recedes into the hinterland and more importantly into the 
			interior. Sojourn is a photographic series of landscape images taken over a period of six years across Southern Africa.</p>
