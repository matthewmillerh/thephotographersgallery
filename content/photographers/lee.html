			<p class="justified">After working as a reportage photographer in Afghanistan for nine months, Junho Lee ventured into music direction while studying law in South Korea. Receiving second place in a short film-making contest held by his university during this time, Lee discovered the wonders of film and began experimenting with photography as a medium.</p>
			<p>Travels to Italy and South Africa, where Lee settled for a few years before returning to his home country, has focused his attention on the beauty of architecture and the moments of human interaction within the built environment. Often from an almost voyeuristic vantage point, he finds his inspiration in the musical symmetry of his surroundings - the harshness of the Korean winters, as illustrated in his serenely haunting series, Long Tunnel Passes Over The Border, and in the peace of ordinary scenes, such as a book resting on a table or leaves etched against a glowing window.</p>
