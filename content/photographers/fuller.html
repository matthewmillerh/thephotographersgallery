			Fuller's photography offers both an extended view of time as well as multiple perspectives. His images are based on a singular moment - the exposure time required by his self-made multi-apeture pinhole cameras. Studying History at tertiary level shifted Fuller's focus towards time and the various ways in which it is witnessed, recorded and then re-witnessed ad infinitum. His photographs present an inclusive event with multiple vantage points, where each frame is non-discreet. The information seen is shared by all frames, but with different weightings: Each frame bares witness to the moment in a different way. Some see too much (the over-exposed) and others donâ€™t see anything at all (the under-exposed).</p>
			<p class="justified">Together as a unit, the way these frames bare witness to an event comes closer to the human experience than the single, split-second shot of the DSLR camera. Although each frame tells a unique story, they all share a common thread - the thread of the moment, the event that they experienced together. Fuller's images thus all aim to illustrate the intricacy of any given narrative and highlights the fact that, as much as we would desire to have it, there is no absolute truth. As time passes, facts become fuzzy and imprecise, viewpoints change and memories fade. His photographs capture the impermanence of time and leave the viewer with a subtle suggestion that truth has been replaced by probability and hypothesis and that we are meant to seek out the one that fits best.</p>
