<p class="justified">Dreams to Reality showcases a diverse range of photography from a number of established 
and emerging photographers alike. The show explores differing styles of photography, as well as showcasing the 
versatility ofthe medium.</p>
<p class="justified">Dreams to Reality had its genesis in an open call from Erdmann Contemporary for photographic 
projects. We received a large number of proposals, from which we curated the majority of the work on display.</p>
<p class="justified">What struck me most about initially seeing the work was the sheer diversity of photography. 
While each photographer worked within the realm of photography, each also had an undeniable, unique, style. I was
 struck by the different ways in which a photographer may choose to reflect or distort reality.</p>
<p class="justified">There is deconstructionist theory that expresses that art is that which dehabitualises the 
world around us. By making the familiar unfamiliar, the artist makes us re-evaluate and readdress our lives. In 
the group ofphotographs chosen for Dreams to Reality, this idea was present. Each of the works somehow manages to
 distort or reflect our lives in order to make us re-examine it. Initially, this was the focus of the show.</p>
<p class="justified">It was only later on that the show took on the more defined theme of Dreams to Reality. I 
liked the ambiguity of the title. Where so much of the show allowed for various interpretations of work depending
 on one's person freight of understanding, it seemed only fitting that the title do likewise. I liked that it could
 depict our dreams for the future, such as our hopes or expectations, as well as the dreams one has that have 
 absolutely no basis in reality, such as when we sleep. The theme seemed to match the eclectic group of photographs 
 and photographers I had had the pleasure of working with.</p>
<p class="justified">The theme suggests that the works each had aspects of the dream-world and that of reality 
within them. This was done because of the nature of dreams. Dreams, and I speak now of the type of dreams one has 
when asleep - even friendly or innocuous dreams - often linger in one's mind. Some of the pieces were chosen because 
they obviously depict the dream-like nature of thoughts and some because the narrative behind the photograph provides 
a deeper sense of dreams. Again, the ambiguity of the term "Dream", and the way in which the viewer interprets that 
meaning, often seems to determine the experience that viewer has with each specific photograph.</p>
<p class="justified">The show was set up in a way to confront the viewer with the sense of unreal. Ultimately, I tried 
to fool the viewer into forgetting that each photograph was, in fact a captured moment of the real world around us. 
Although photographs are not true reality, they are constrained by reality.</p>
<p class="justified">Photography must capture an image, as opposed to something like painting, which can create one. 
In this sense, photography is often constrained by reality. With this exhibition, the goal is to make the viewer forget 
that they are, indeed, seeing aspects that come from the same world they exist in on a daily basis.</p>
