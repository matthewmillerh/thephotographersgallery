<h2 class="names">Bobson Studio Portraits</h2></br></br>

<p class="justified">My interest in studio photography came via Revue Noir publications and magazines found at the South African National Gallery library from 1994 until 1997.  That is where I discovered the works of Mountaga Dembélé, Seydou Keita, Malick Sidibé, Abderramane Sakaly and Felix Diallo amongst others.</p>   

<p class="justified">An exhibition of work in this genre only came in February 1997 when I offered to be a social photographer to the opening of Black Photo Album 1890 - 1950.  The South African National Gallery, where I was working (and not as a photographer) hosted this exhibition at its then satellite space, The Natale Labia Museum in Muizenberg.  The exhibition was curated by South African photographer, Santu Mofokeng and featured a collection of digitally reworked 19th century, colonial portraits of Black South African families.  In Mofokeng’s opening address he noted that “when we look at them we believe them, for they tell us a little about how these people imagined themselves. We see these images in the terms determined by the subjects themselves, for they have made them their own."</p>    
 
<p class="justified">At the end of 1997, I found an exhibition catalogue entitled 'Street Dreams', which opened a completely new window onto the genre of studio photography.   The exhibition, 'Street Dreams: Contemporary Indian Studio Photographs from the Satish Sharma Collection' was hosted at Standpoint Gallery in London in 1997.  Sharma writes in the catalogue introduction “these photographs, though, are more than just a consciously mediated form of self-representation.  These images are the signs and the icons of their times.  They reflect the reality of a contemporary world.  A world where a religious mythology continues to be a permanent and powerful presence.”</p>      
           
<p class="justified">The following year, in 1998, I had the privilege of being introduced to the works of South African studio photographer, Sukdeo Bobson Mohanlall.  Durban born photographer Lance Slabbert then an acclaimed surf photographer, whose images had earned him international recognition had befriended Mohanlall and regularly visited his studio in Cross Street.  When Mohanlall told Slabbert that he needed to destroy all his colour negatives from the 1970’s Slabbert strongly advised against it.  Mohanlall needed to create storage space, the market demands had changed and camera accessories and batteries had become his primary business.  Instead of destroying the negatives the two decided to collaborate on an exhibition. Slabbert produced a series of work entitled Street Style.  A make shift studio was set up on Durban’s busy inner city streets and Slabbert invited passers-by to have their portraits taken.  Mohanlall printed a selection of his 1970’s colour negatives which then became known as the Bobson Studio Portraits.  The exhibition opened at Durban’s NSA Gallery in September 1998.  It was Mohanlall’s first exhibition, and unbeknown then, the first of many more to follow.</p>

<p class="justified">Mohanlall was the owner of the Bobson Studio in Durban.  It led to the assumed name of Mr Bobson, he was also known as Bobby Bobson.  The studio was opened on Durban’s Cross Street, corner of Alice Street, in 1961.  Mohanlall was fatally shot behind the same counter he had stood serving his customers for more than forty years.  The two gun-armed youths escaped with R 40.00 in cash.  Mohanlall’s daughter, then a Durban based lawyer called to give me this tragic news.  My last conversation with Mr Mohanlall was in December 2002.  I had finally promised him a black and white self portrait, something I had promised for more than two years.  He was very proud of the studio’s hand coloured portraits, despite its dwindling market appeal.</p>

<p class="justified">In 2000 I received a larger order for Bobson Studio Portraits from an Italian collector.  I was seven months pregnant at the time, and my husband travelled to Durban to make the acquisition. Mohanlall was extremely pleased with the sale but even happier when my husband decided to also purchase one of the studio’s hand coloured portraits as a gift for me; in its original wooden rectangle frame.  In that last conversation with Mohanlall he urged me to hurry up.  The studio’s hand colouring work was out-sourced and his favourite artist was aging.  I laughed – because Mohanlall was not a young man himself, and his family was not happy with him still going to the studio each day.  His son Vicky was there to manage the day to day business, but so was Mohanlall Senior.  His death deprived me of more than just a hand coloured portrait, but I was left with fond memories and a privilege of having known and worked with Bobby Bobson.  Despite our numerous sales over the years, I only had one print in my holding at the time of Mohanlall’s death; printed under his sanctioned supervision.</p>      
               
<p class="justified">I hosted Mohanlall and Slabbert’s two part exhibition at AREA Gallery in Cape Town in December 1998.  The following year the photographs were selected for In-Transit – an exhibition of contemporary South African art organized by the Swiss Arts Council Pro-Helvetia which went on view in Zurich, Switzerland. </p>
 
<p class="justified">In 1999 I met Dr Christraud Geary; she was in Cape Town for an international photography conference held at the South African Museum.  It’s then Director, Dr Patricia Davidson had accepted a proposal to host the Bobson Studio Portraits and Slabbert’s Street Style exhibitions at the museum during the run of the conference. The exhibition was criticized by a speaker who took to the podium and voiced his objections to the material.  I do not recall his name, only his outrage. I have remained indebted to the sound advice offered by Dr Geary later that day.</p>
   
<p class="justified">In February 2001, Studio d’Arte Raffaelli in Trento, Italy, hosted a solo exhibition, titled Bobson Portraits, and published an exhibition catalogue for which I wrote the catalogue essay.  In 2002, Mohanlall’s portraits were included in an exhibition Passport to South Africa, Contemporary South African art, which was hosted at the Trevi Cultural Centre in Bolzano.  William Kentridge, Marlene Dumas, Willie Bester and Sam Nhlengethwa were amongst the featured artists.</p>
       
<p class="justified">Mohanlall and I never met personally; we only ever spoke on the telephone, regularly and for long periods at a time.  He told me about his interest in photography, his collecting habits, and his working days at a photographic processing firm.  Bobson Studio was opened when Mohanlall and a long time friend were both retrenched from that company.</p>
      
<p class="justified">In the early days, just after they opened, the business operated each day of the week, and weekend days were their busiest.  Throughout the 1960’s all the printing, then only in black and white was done on the premises.  I never saw any of the black and white prints from that time.  It could be that by the time Slabbert advised Mohanlall against destroying his colour negatives, the black and white negatives may have been destroyed already. </p> 

<p class="justified">Mohanlall told me how on weekend days, the queues would snake down Cross and Alice streets.  I regret never asking him about his backdrops, thus I have no idea as to how often he change these, if ever?  The props belonged to the studio and so did the beadwork as featured in many of the Bobson portraits.  The beadwork is from the Ndwandwe tribe who lived in an area just outside Durban, known as the Valley of a Thousand Hills.  The props were kept in boxes and can often be seen in some of the portraits, as would be the shoes and socks pushed aside by those being photographed.</p>
  
<p class="justified">By the early 1970’s the industry had changed with a greater demand for colour photography.  Unlike most of the studios elsewhere in Africa, Mohanlall embraced the change and found a colour processing firm in Durban to handle his printing.  It would be the images from this era that brought Mohanlall his legacy.  At the time of his death the trusted Yashica Matt camera, used to take all those photographs was proudly displayed in the studio.  Therein lies my second regret – we never really spoke about the actual photographs, the taking of the images, apart from the camera that was used.</p>
  
<p class="justified">For the exhibition catalogue in 2001, Mohanlall sent me a photograph of his shop, taken from the outside.  It was not very big.  The front door was recessed, with glass display windows on either side showing an assortment of framed portraits. The back wall is central in this photograph; two red curtains are pushed aside to reveal a tranquil mountainous landscape.  A ring of fake flowers, head high height was attached onto this backdrop.  It was 2001and Mohanlall was still in the business of taking studio portraits.</p>

<p class="justified">Our online exhibition is presented in the memory of a great studio photographer, also known as Bobby Bobson.</p>
