<p class="justified">Erdmann Contemporary and The Photographers Gallery ZA are now offering acclaimed human rights photographer and World Photographic Academy member Jürgen Schadeberg’s series “Voices from the Land” as a possible touring exhibition.
</p>
<p class="justified">This stunning collection will feature Schadeberg’s photographic study looking at farm conditions in South Africa today. According to Schadeberg, this exhibition is about "the lives of farm workers, their plight, their problems, their hopes and fears" - a persisting issue that has been on his mind for many years. 
</p>
<p class="justified">I travelled to the far corners of South Africa with writers such as Hazel Friedman, Stephan Hofstätter and others, where we found some promising and positive situations where farmers are providing for their workers by giving them a dignified and comfortable lifestyle. However, many farm workers are still living in unacceptable conditions an d many are being evicted from their birth place. We allowed these men and women to talk about their lives and their problems, their grief and their anger. Many of the evictees we met were elderly and in bad health, a vulnerable and powerless group for which a farmer has little use, even though they might have sacrificed most of their lives in service. In many cases we found the poor conditions endured by farm workers unacceptable in the New South Africa.</i></p>
<p class="justified"><i>This [exhibition] does not paint a black and white picture of the situation on farms with victims and perpetrators, but rather a picture with various shades of grey. It is not an investigative report where we make judgements, but rather an attempt to open the eyes of society, particularly of those people in the urban areas who never come into contact with rural life and people... This project is aimed at creating a greater awareness of rural problems to deflect possible conflict and to promote harmony, peace and prosperity... There is hope on the horizon with committed farmers and organizations working hard towards a better quality of life and better future for all rural people. We should ink in terms of nurturing rather than destroying the hands that feed us; and we should not forget that our progressive Constitution, where the preservation of dignity, human rights, water, education and shelter is paramount, extends also to farm workers.</i> - Jurgen Schadeberg, Johannesburg, May 2005.</p>
